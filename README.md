Some work on the paper, "Automated Lie-algebraic input space partitioning using 
first-order two-dimensional cellular automata" by me (Shrohan Mohapatra. (2020, June 5). 
Automated Lie-algebraic input space partitioning using first-order two-dimensional cellular 
automata. Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3880404), here in the specific example with 
Game of Life for automated Lie-algebraic input space partitioning.

There have been studies that analyse and apply input space partitioning by categorising them into 
classes such as equivalence partitioning, boundary value testing, category partitions, domain testing,
classification trees, etc. This paper proposes a new algorithm for automated input domain modeling with
randomised test case generation in a classification tree adhering to some Lie-algebraic structures 
using a scalable parallelised framework of first-order two-dimensional cellular automata that 
encompasses a large number of test cases simultaneously. As a proof of concept, this computational 
system is compared to a physical system described by a Yang-Mills theory of hypothetical quanta of 
certain gauge-invariant fields that follow the symmetries followed by the Lie algebras considered, 
in the foreground of the chaotic system as a continuum limit of the cellular automata, and the test 
cases are compared to the corresponding Feynman diagrams. Brief complexity analyses and brief 
analogies between the proof and the Feynman diagrammatics, algebraic complexity theory, and finite 
difference methods have also discussed.
